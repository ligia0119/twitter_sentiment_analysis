"negative","in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar ."

"negative","the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture ."
"negative","it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , "" look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! "" but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging ."
"negative","the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid ."

"negative","it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed ."
"negative","avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book ."
"negative","a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda ."
"negative","while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context ."
"negative","woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the "" saving private ryan "" battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ?"
"negative","it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun ."

"negative","this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter ."
"negative","why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one ."
